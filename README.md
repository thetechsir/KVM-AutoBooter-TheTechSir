boot any vfio guest right from your boot loader, I made this solution since I don't always want macOS &amp; Windows booting. until now I had three host os for the purpose of auto booting with just X11 on all opus, one for my Nvidia and win11 autobot KVM, and one for my AMD Mac KVM. This method will guide you to create systems service for each guest you want to be able to trigger auto booting from boot loader.
